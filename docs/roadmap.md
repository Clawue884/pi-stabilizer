Roadmap
--------

This document outlines the roadmap for the Pi Stabilizer system.

### Short-term Goals (Next 3 Months)

* Improve the stabilization algorithm to reduce latency and increase accuracy
* Add support for additional Raspberry Pi devices
* Improve the user interface and user experience of the Grafana dashboard

### Mid-term Goals (Next 6-12 Months)

* Integrate with additional monitoring systems (e.g. Nagios, Zabbix)
* Develop a mobile app for remote monitoring and control
* Implement automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

### Long-term Goals (Next 1-2 Years)

* Develop a cloud-based version of the Pi Stabilizer system
* Integrate with machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance
* Expand support to other single-board computers (e.g. Asus Tinker Board, Pine64)

### Future Development

* Explore the use of edge computing and IoT technologies to further improve the system's performance and scalability
* Develop a community-driven plugin ecosystem for the Pi Stabilizer system
* Investigate the use of blockchain technology for secure and transparent data storage and sharing
