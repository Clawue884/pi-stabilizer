Architecture
------------

The Pi Stabilizer system consists of several components that work together to provide real-time monitoring and stabilization of Raspberry Pi devices. The architecture is designed to be scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.

### Components

* **Pi Stabilizer Application**: A Python application that runs on the Raspberry Pi device and is responsible for stabilizing the device. It uses advanced algorithms to monitor and adjust the device's performance in real-time.
* **Prometheus Exporter**: A Prometheus exporter that exposes metrics about the Pi device's stability. It is used to collect data about the device's performance and make it available for monitoring and analysis.
* **Grafana Dashboard**: A customizable Grafana dashboard that provides a visual representation of the Pi device's stability metrics. It allows users to easily monitor and analyze the device's performance.
* **Docker Container**: A Docker container that packages the Pi Stabilizer application, Prometheus exporter, and Grafana dashboard. It provides a lightweight and portable way to deploy the system.

### Data Flow

1. The Pi Stabilizer application collects data about the Raspberry Pi device's performance and sends it to the Prometheus exporter.
2. The Prometheus exporter exposes the data as metrics, which are then scraped by Prometheus.
3. Prometheus stores the metrics in its database, making them available for querying and analysis.
4. The Grafana dashboard queries Prometheus for the metrics and displays them in a visual format.
5. Users can access the Grafana dashboard to monitor and analyze the Pi device's performance.

### Benefits

* Real-time monitoring of Pi stability
* Advanced stabilization algorithm for optimal performance
* Customizable Grafana dashboard for easy analysis
* Scalable and flexible architecture for easy maintenance and updates
